# Marvel Landing Page

This repository houses the necessary assets for the "Marvel" landing page. The
"Marvel" logo uses a font found on www.fontspace.com. The sections on the page 
have ID selectors used to build the navigation bar at the load time of the assets.
The page is responsive and utilizes media queries to do so. When the screen width is
768 pixels or less, the navigation bar is converted to a sidebar. The sidebar pops
in when the 'hamburger' lines are clicked.
